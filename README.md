## To Run on your machine:
### First run chatbot.py file to train the model
### Then run app.py to actually get the chatbot

This is a simple implementation of creating a chatbot using Sequential Deep Neural Network. I used json files as my dataset to train the Sequential model and Flask for the GUI.
